## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope.

1. To begin, [fork this project](fork), clone your fork, and add our upstream.
```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/calcite-base
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd calcite-base
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/esri/calcite-base
# Install the tools necessary for development
npm install
```

2. Create a branch for your feature or fix:
```bash
# Move into a new branch for a feature
git checkout -b feature/thing
```
```bash
# Move into a new branch for a fix
git checkout -b fix/something
```

3. Start up a local development server:
```bash
# Use the start script to run the default dev environment
npm start
```

4. Be sure your code follows our practices.
```bash
# Test current code
npm run test
```

5. Push your branch up to your fork:
```bash
