# Calcite Base

The calcite-base repository holds the variables and mixins used in Calcite Web. This includes resources regarding:

- motion (easing functions, transitions)
- type (font stacks, sizing, spacing mixins)
- colors (aliases for [@esri/calcite-colors](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors), UI colors, etc)
- reponsive design (breakpoints, respond-to mixins)

## Install

If you use npm, installation is as easy as:

```
npm install @esri/calcite-base
```

You can also [download the latest release manually](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/releases).

## Use

In a Sass project, simply import calcite-base into your project and use the variables/mixins:

```scss
@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/_index.scss";

.myClass {
  color: $blue;
  @include font-size(-1);
}
```

If you want to override any of the variables locally, make sure you put your declarations _first_:

```scss
$blue: #0196ff; // local override for blue

@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/_base.scss";
```

If you only require certain modules, and don't want to litter your Sass scope with all the variables and mixins, you can import each section directly as well:

```scss
@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/sass/_type.scss";

.myClass {
  @include avenir-light();
  @include font-size(-1);
  @include leading(2);
  @include tracking(166);
  @include word-spacing(200);
}
```

### Custom Properties

If you are using PostCSS (or standard CSS) there are a series of files which declare the variables utilizing [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (CSS Variables). You can use these along with something like the [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties) library to utilize the base colors, styles, etc in your postcss project:

```css
@import './node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/post-css/base.css';

.myClass {
  color: var(--blue);
}
```

### JavaScript

If you need some of these values and are using a CSS-in-JS approach, you can import them from the JavaScript file:

```js
const calciteBase = require('@esri/calcite-base');
console.log(calciteBase.blue); // "#007ac2"
```

If you have ES6 modules, you can also grab just what you need:

```js
import {avenirLight} from "@esri/calcite-base";
console.log(avenirLight); // '"Avenir Next", "Avenir", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif'
```
