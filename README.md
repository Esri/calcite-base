# Calcite Base

The calcite-base repository holds the variables and mixins used in Calcite Web. This includes resources regarding:

- motion (easing functions, transitions)
- type (font stacks, sizing, spacing mixins)
- reponsive design (breakpoints, respond-to mixins)
- utilities (clearfix, show/hide, etc)
- shadow (defined levels of depth)
- spacing (standardized vertical/horizontal spacing units)

## Install

If you use npm, installation is as easy as:

```
npm install @esri/calcite-base
```

You can also [download the latest release manually](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/releases).

## Use

In a Sass project, simply import calcite-base into your project and use the variables/mixins:

```scss
@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/dist/_index.scss";

.myClass {
  @include font-size(-1);
}
```

If you only require certain mixins, you can import each section directly as well:

```scss
@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/dist/_type.scss";

.myClass {
  @include avenir-light();
  @include font-size(-1);
  @include leading(2);
  @include tracking(166);
  @include word-spacing(200);
}
```

### Custom Properties

If you are using PostCSS (or standard CSS) there are a series of files which declare the variables utilizing [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (CSS Variables). You can use these along with something like the [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties) library to utilize the base colors, styles, etc in your postcss project:

```css
@import "./node_modules/@esri/calcite-base/dist/variables.css";

.myClass {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1);
}
```

### JavaScript

If you need some of these values and are using a CSS-in-JS approach, you can import them from the JavaScript file using ES6 modules:

```js
import {avenirLight} from "@esri/calcite-base";
console.log(avenirLight); // '"Avenir Next", "Avenir", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif'
```

Note when using partial imports like this, the hyphenated variables become camel case.
